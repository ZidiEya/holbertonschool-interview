Here's a full recap of your project 0-find_loop.c from Holberton's "find the loop in a singly linked list" interview prep task:

✅ Goal
Implement a function that detects the start of a loop in a singly linked list without using:

malloc

free

arrays

global variables

more than 2 variables inside the function

✅ Function Prototype
c
Copier
Modifier
listint_t *find_listint_loop(listint_t *head);
✅ Approach Used
You used Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare):

Move one pointer (turtle) one step at a time.

Move another pointer (hare) two steps at a time.

If they meet, a loop exists.

To find the start of the loop:

Reset turtle to head

Move both one step at a time until they meet again — that’s the start of the loop.
